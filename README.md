This is an OCaml library that provides an implementation of the
epsilon-greedy solution to the multiarmed-bandit problem,
using exponential moving averages for a faster adaptation to new
trends.

Practical use: finding out which variant of a user interface is most often
successful while maximizing the overall success rate as the system
is learning.
